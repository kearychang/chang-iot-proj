### Bike LED Indicator

This controls 2 relays attached to LEDs. 
It relies on 3 way switch to flicker the left or right LED.
There is a HAZARD state which flickers both LEDS, but disables changing via the switch.

You can change the brightness, frequency and state using an IR remote.

When the sequence LEFT MID LEFT MID RIGHT MID is read within 2.75s, 
it enters HAZARD mode.
